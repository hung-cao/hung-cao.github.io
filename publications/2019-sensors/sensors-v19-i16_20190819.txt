ABSTRACT = {Exploring Internet of Things (IoT) data streams generated by smart cities means not only transforming data into better business decisions in a timely way but also generating long-term location intelligence for developing new forms of urban governance and organization policies. This paper proposes a new architecture based on the edge-fog-cloud continuum to analyze IoT data streams for delivering data-driven insights in a smart parking scenario.},
